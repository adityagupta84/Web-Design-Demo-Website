                <h3>HTML5 Markup</h3>
                <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web
                browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading
                Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
                
                Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web
                pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</p>

                <h3>CSS3 Styling</h3>
                <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document
                written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).
            
                Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for
                different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on
                Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile
                device. </p>
